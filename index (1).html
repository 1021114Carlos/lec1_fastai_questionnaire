<h1>Lecture 1 questionnaire:</h1>
    <p>1. Do you need these for Deep Learning?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lot of math T/F </li>
            <li>Lots of data T/F</li>
            <li>Lots of expensive computers T/F</li>
            <li>A PhD T/F</li>
        </ul>
    <p>2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.</p>
    <p>3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron</p>
    <p>4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing</p>
    <p>5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the theory of neural networks</p>
    <p>6. What is a GPU?</p>
    <p>7. Open an new notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens?</p>
    <p>8. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen</p>
    <p>9. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix </p>
    <p>10. Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?</p>
    <p>11. What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment"?</p>
    <p>12. What term do we normally use in deep learning for wht Samuel called "weights"</p>
    <p>13. Draw a picture that summirizes Samuel's view of a ML model</p>
    <p>14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction? </p>
    <p>15. What is the name of theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy </p>
    <p>16. What do you need in order to train a model</p>
    <p>17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?</p>
    <p>18. Do we always have to use a 224x224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?</p>
    <p>19. What is the difference between classification and regression?</p>
    <p>20. What is the difference between classification and regression</p>
    <p>21. What is a validation set, what is a test set and why do we need them?</p>
    <p>22. Can we always use a random sample for validation set? if so, why?</p>
    <p>23. What is overfitting? provide an example</p>
    <p>24. What is a metric? How does it differ from loss?</p>
    <p>25. How can pretrain models help?</p>
    <p>26. What is the "head" of a model?</p>
    <p>27. What kind of figures  do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers</p>
    <p>28. Are image models only useful for photos?</p>
    <p>29. What is an "architecture"</p>
    <p>30. What is a segmentation?</p>
    <p>31. What is y_range used for and when do we need it?</p>
    <p>32. What is hyperparameters?</p>
    <p>33. What is the best way to avoid failure when using AI in an organization</p>
